# Basic-speech-recognition
recognize the voice spoken on microphone and returns it in text as well as speech format
This uses the google speech to text conversion to convert the speech on microphone into the text .
It uses the python PyAudio functionality to navigate into the wave audio files.
the structure of running is similar : first intro sound is played and after user is required to speak and finally the end sound plays 
and if the code recognizes the speech then it displays the text and speaks it
